            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>Boil Macaroni </h4>
                    Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes. 
                </li>

                    <h4>Make a Roux</h4>
                    While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux.
                    <br>
                    A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese.
                    <br>
                    To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. 
                    <br>
                    Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth.
                    <br>
                    Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn.

                    <h4>Add Cheese and Macaroni</h4>
                    Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese!
                    <br>
                    Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted.
                    <br>
                    We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese.
                    <br>
                    Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.
